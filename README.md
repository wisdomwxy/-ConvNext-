This program uses a trained ConvNext neural network for garbage classification. The camera senses the garbage placed on the feeding platform and transmits the collected information into the neural network, and then the result is judged based on the output of the neural network, and the corresponding servo is controlled by Arduino to complete the corresponding action.
